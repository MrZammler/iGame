## iGame VERSION_TAG - [RELEASE_DATE]
### Added
- Some nonWHDLoad games require to be started from their own folder, otherwise they crash or fail to start. This is a problem mainly on systems that do not have WBRun or WBLoad (i.e. AmigaOS 3.1). Now, for all the added games/demos that are started on such systems a temporary script is created under T:.

### Changed
- Now we compile iGame with NDK 3.2R4
- Now the repositories path requester accepts only drawers
- When the user selects a relative path (ie. //Games), that changes to an absolute path.
- Changed the way the same title slaves are counted. This will help for removing the multiple "Alt" words in the list
- Changed the repository scanning for files. The code is simplified and now uses more functions from the system API, making it more compatible. Also, all the "Data" folders are skipped from scanning, so slaves that exist in those folders are not used. A lot of code was removed and optimised, so the scan is now around 37% faster on the same machine, scanning a folder with 3562 entries.
- Changed the way the multiple instances with the same title are shown. Now no "Alt" labels will be added. Instead, we introduced a number in square brackets that represent the different instances, i.e. 3DPool [1], 4DSportsDriving [2]. Not every record has these values, so expect to see them only when there are duplicates.
- The gamelist.csv file changed by having double quotes around the string values, like the path and the title.
- A new column was added in the gamelist.csv file which holds the custom name of the item. The old column remains unchanged. This helps in situations like a repository rescan, where the given name by the user doesn't change. The old second column should remain unchanged.
- Now iGame requires icon.library v44+ for changing icon tooltypes. For systems that do include a new version, there is icon.library 46.4 on Aminet is free to download and use. Those that have older versions of the library will still be able to use iGame, but they won't be able to change the icon tooltypes. They will need to do it from Workbench
- Now the filter string field is not disabled in the hidden list, allowing the user to filter the results based on the title or part of it
- "Status" line, "Times played" and "Slave path" do not have a border anymore, since they are read-only fields
- "No smart spaces" has a proper border now
- "Slave path" in the item properties window doesn't stretch its width anymore. If MUI 5 is used the text will be shortened, showing three dots in the middle of it.
- If WBLoad exists in the C: folder, this is going to be used to start games/demos from WB, when they were added as extra items in the list

### Fixed
- When a user changes the tooltypes of a slave, the NewIcon keeps working. The previous versions of iGame were deleting the image information. Now they are dropped from the icon tooltypes, but the image keeps working fine. As a result, the .info file size is reduced almost to half.
- Now it is possible to save the icon tooltypes even if it is used as an item screenshot

## iGame 2.2.1 - [2023-01-30]
### Added
- Added Turkish catalog contributed by Serkan Dursun

### Fixed
- Now the 68K cpu specific versions are included in the archive. In v2.2.0 all versions where the same 68000 binary because of a missing flag in compilation
- Willem Drijver contributed with a fix on Execute tooltype, which was not working well.

### Changed
- Removed the tooltypes from the iGame icons. They are not used any more

## iGame 2.2.0 - [2022-11-06]
### Added
- Added automatic release to Aminet and OS4Depot through the CI/CD whenever a new release tag is created at the repo

### Changed
- Removed completely the Tooltypes. Now iGame defaults to the optimal settings and uses only the settings file to change its behaviour.
- Now if the file "envarc:igame.prefs" exists then this is used by iGame, instead of the one that exists at the PROGDIR:. This way multiple iGame instances will have common settings (#173)
- Introducing semantic versioning. No beta versions any more. Now the versions will have three digits based on MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern. More info at https://semver.org/

## iGame 2.1 - [2022-06-04]
### Changed
- Did some fixes on libraries checks during application start based on the selected tooltypes
- Some minor fixes
- Update icons' positions to not overlap each other
- Added NOSIDEPANEL to iGame tooltypes that was missing

... plus all the changes that were released in previous beta versions (2.1b1 up to 2.1b3), which you can see below

## iGame 2.1b3 - [2021-12-04]
### Added
- Added a check if the screenshot image is supported by the installed datatypes. If not, it is skipped. This fixes situations where the Info datatype is not installed and no image is shown instead of the default.

### Fixed
- Fixed the menus on Aros 68k. Menus should work on ApolloOS now.

### Changed
- The games list is not multiselect now. This speeds up a little bit the selection of games on slow machines.
- Moved the strings methods to a separate file. Also merged the strcasestr.c and strdup.c files.
- Moved the filesystem methods to a separate file.
- Set local methods as static in the funcs.c and cleaned up the iGameExtern.h from the shared methods
- Now all the libraries open on application start and close on application exit. No OpenLibrary() calls in the middle of the application.
- Moved the joystick methods from iGameMain.c to funcs.c
- A lot of global methods and variables removed
- A lot of refactoring happened, so to make funcs.c file smaller. This makes code more clear and readable.
- All the necessary libraries and interfaces are set to be loaded in the code. No "-lauto" is necessary any more.
- Changed the localization system to support the new menus. Now the strings header file is created based on catcomp

## iGame 2.1b2 - [2021-03-15]
### Added
- Added iGame version at the screen title

### Updated
- Updated Italian catalog
- Updated Greek catalog
### Fixed
- Fixed starting whdload games that have tooltypes start with the characters »«.=#!
- Fixed starting whdload games/demos that the Slave path is missing. Now an error message is shown, and iGame doesn't crash hard, bringing down the whole system.

### Added
- Three extra PNG icons contributed by Carlo Spadoni
- Added Greek translation

### Fixed
