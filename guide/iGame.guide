@NODE "INTR" "Introduction"

iGame is a program that provides a front-end to games installed with whdload
on your machine.

It can "discover" your games on pre-defined repositories and create a small
database. You can then categorize each game according to it's genre, provide
a small image to be displayed when the game is selected, and quickly find the
one you're looking for using the Filter gadget.

But not just whdload games. You can add and launch any type of executable, though
it mostly makes sense if it's a game ;-)

iGame was initialy developed on an Amiga 3000 with a CSMKII 68060 with 128MB RAM,
using the Cubic IDE (gcc). Nowdays, I'm using Emacs on linux and vbcc as a cross
compiler.

iGame is open source and free software, licenced under the GPL.

And a bit of history:

iGame started in ~2004/5 as a way to learn a bit of MUI and general Amiga system
coding. Through the years it's been updated with various new small features and
bug fixes. After version 1.5, iGame was updated with internal version 1.6 which
was never really officialy released. Sorry; I wasn't very good at releasing
versions or keeping a changelog.

Since then Dimitris Panokostas did a lot of re-writing and new features (such as
the settings window to replace tooltypes). These versions are now tagged as 2.0
betas.

To be completed.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "REQS" "Requirements"

REQUIREMENTS

Hardware

 - Amiga Computer with at least 68020 processor
 - 2 MB RAM min.

To be perfectly honest, iGame requirements depend on the amount of installed games.
I'd say a healthy ok would be an 68030 and 16MB of fast ram, but it is run okay on a 020
system. (Havent tried on 00, let me know about it).

On a 030 processor, it takes a while to scan and list the games. Typical
numbers are about 2 mins for a complete scan of an SFS formated 5G partition
with almost 2000 games (~3G data).

On a 060 with ~200 games, scanning takes ~30 secs and listing/sorting <1 sec.

A good amount of stack. Due to it's recursive scan, ~32000 is ok. If you find that iGame
crashes, check the stack first, and then report a bug.

Software

 - Kickstart 2.04 or higher
 - Workbench 2.1 or higher
 - guigfx.library
 - render.library
 - guigfx.mcc
 - Texteditor.mcc

@ENDNODE
@NODE "INST" "Installation"

No supplied installer yet, so you must do the following by hand:

  1. Unpack the archive.

  2. Copy the iGame drawer anywhere on your hard disk.

  3. Make sure the igame.iff file is in the same dir as the binary.

  4. Install required libs and mccs suitable for your system.

  5. Run iGame!

iGame saves it's support files in the PROGDIR:, so it's best to use a separate
directory. If you are upgrading from a previous release, then just copy the new
executable over the old one. Make sure to keep the gameslist and repos.prefs files
if you're upgrading!

-- NOTE:

Make sure that render.library and guigfx.library are ok for your system/processor.
If iGame fails with guru 8000000B or similar at startup, double check the libraries.
If it still persists, check http://igame.amigahellas.gr. On the files section you
will find an archive of these 2 libraries for systems with 020/no fpu (thanks to
Jools 'buzz' Smyth for providing them!). These might fix things even for 030/882 systems.
Try those. If the problem is still there, add the NOGUIGFX tooltype to iGame.
This will use MUI's internal dt loading routines (dtpic.mui) instead of guigfx.mcc's.
In this case though, there will be no scaling of the screenshots you load, so each
one you add must be of the same size as the others.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "USAG" "Using iGame"

The first thing to do, when you start iGame for the first time, is to add
one or more "repositories", i.e. paths on your system drives that you have
games installed.

For example, you might have a whole partition dedicated to games, or a
folder inside a partition. So, add a repository ;-)

Next step is to scan the repositories. iGame searches for slave files. After
the search, the results are saved to disk, so you only need to do this once.
(or whenever you add or remove a game to your repository so iGame can keep an
up-to-date database).

The list will be populated with the results, the game title that will appear will
be the directory name where each slave was located, or the title from the slave
file, if it containes one.

Multiple slaves for the same game will be suffixed with the 'Alt' word.

Then, just double-click on a game, and it will run! The list can be filtered
by typing a part of the game name you're looking for, or by using the genres list
on the right. If the slave file has an .info file associated with it, it will
use whatever tooltypes there are in the .info file, else it will launch it with
whdload default parameters.

You can edit some game's properties from the "Game properties" menu. You can change
the title, the genre so it will be filtered accordingly, whether it's one of your
favorites, and the games tooltypes, as you would do in it's info file.

You can also choose to hide the game from the list. It will not appear in any searching
or genre filtering. Choose "Show/Hide hidden slaves" from the menu, to list those slaves.
To go back to normal games listing, click on the same menu item again.

From the menu, you can also open up the drawer containing the game.

To add a screenshot to appear when a game is selected, simply save an image in
the game's folder with the name igame.iff. Note, the image can be of any type
as long as you have the proper datatype installed. It should however still
have .iff as it's extension, even though it may be a png file.

Under some circumstances, newicons icons from games could be displayed on the screenshot box.
This is still under testing.

The genres list on the right side of the application is stored in a file called 'genres'.
This file must be in the same directory as iGame itself. To add or remove genres
just edit this file with your favorite editor.

There are a few toolypes you can set to configure iGame. The SCREENSHOT tooltype
will define the size of the screenshot part of the application. Use whatever
size it fits your display. Any image will be scaled to fit that part. Use
SCREENSHOT=WIDTHxHEIGHT to define it. Default is half the PAL low res screenmode (160x128).

FILTERUSEENTER causes the filter to wait for an enter instead of searching as you
type. This is useful for slower machines.

SAVESTATSONEXIT: Use this tooltype to let iGame know you don't need saving your games
statistics each time a game is launched. Instead it will save them when you quit iGame.
Of course this implies that if a game crashes and the amiga is rebooted, statistics are
lost.

Since version 1.3, the 'update_titles' utility is included. It is intended for
people who used iGame before 1.3. Update_titles will scan your slave files
from the gameslist, extract titles from the slaves and update the gameslist
file. To use, open a shell window, go to the dir where iGame is installed and
run update_titles (no options). You may wish to keep a copy of gameslist file
in case something goes wrong or you dont like the titles from the slaves. The
gameslist file and update_lists must be in the same dir. Remember to use a good
amount of stack before running (32000 should be ok).

Most of the other parts of iGame should be easy to figure. ;-)

@ENDNODE
@NODE "TODO" "Todo"

- Ability to edit global whdload settings.

- Should be possible to retreive game info from a site or something
  (title, genre, publisher, etc).

- Way to display a readme file that comes with the game.

- Fix bugs!

Many people have contacted me with lots of suggestions and feature requests.
Best way now, is to open an issue on github.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "BUGS" "Known bugs/limitations"

- Some Muforce hits have been reported, trying to fix those.

- If you find anything, please let me know, either with an email, or better
yet with an issue on github.
