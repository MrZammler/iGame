@{lindent 3}
iGame is a frontend application for your WHDLoad games and demos collection. It runs on AmigaOS 2.04 and above, AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS.

@{b}Features@{ub}

 - Multiple WHDLoad slaves repositories on hard disk partitions
 - On demand scanning in repositories for installed WHDLoad slaves (games, demos etc.)
 - Use games' tooltypes on run
 - Shows game screenshot (screenshot window can be altered through tooltypes/settings, uses datatypes to load foreign formats)
 - Categorization of the games and filtering
 - Manual addition of non-WHDLoad games, demos etc.
 - Simple statistics
 - Find-as-you-type search filter

iGame can "discover" your games on pre-defined repositories and create a small database. You can then categorize each game according to its genre, provide a small screenshot image to be displayed when the game is selected and quickly find the one you're looking for, using the filter gadget.

But iGame can support more than just WHDLoad games or demos. You can add and launch any type of executable, though it mostly makes sense if it's a game ;-)

iGame can be found on many AmigaOS distributions like AmiKit XE and ApolloOS.

iGame was initially developed on an Amiga 3000 with a CSMKII 68060 with 128MB RAM, using the Cubic IDE (gcc). Nowadays, we use mostly vbcc as a cross compiler on a Linux system.

iGame is open source and free software, licensed under the GPLv3, and you can find it at the following websites.

@NODE "HIST" "History"
@{lindent 3}
A bit of history

iGame started in ~2004/5 as a way to learn a bit of MUI and general Amiga system coding. Through the years it's been updated with various new small features and bug fixes. After version 1.5, iGame was updated with internal version 1.6 which was never really officially released. Sorry; I wasn't very good at releasing versions or keeping a changelog.

Back in 2016 iGame became open source under the GPLv3 license. Since then, with the kind help of contributors, we did a lot of re-writing and added new features. These versions are now tagged as 2.0.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "BUIL" "Building iGame"
@{lindent 3}
iGame is open source and free software, licensed under the GPLv3. This means you can have access to the source and compile it yourself. How to do it is described at the following URL, were various Operating Systems are covered.

https://github.com/MrZammler/iGame/wiki/Compiling-iGame

If you would like to contribute to iGame, please have a look at the following web page:

@ENDNODE
@NODE "REQS" "Requirements"
@{lindent 3}
@{b}Hardware requirements@{ub}

@{u}Minimum requirements@{uu}

 - Amiga Computer (obviously)
 - 68000 processor
 - 2MB Fast Ram

@{u}Recommended requirements@{uu}

 - Amiga Computer (obviously)
 - 68030 processor
 - 8MB Fast Ram

Depending of the number of WHDLoad slaves (games, demos etc.) more available memory might be required.

On a 68030 processor, it takes a while to scan and list the games. It takes about 2 minutes for a complete scan of 2000 games (~3G data) on a SFS formatted partition.

On a 68060 processor with ~200 games, scanning takes ~30 secs and listing/sorting less than 1 sec.

The above times are measured when scan checks the slave files to get the game/demo name. iGame scan is faster if you change that behaviour to get the names from the parent folder name. This can be set on @{"Settings Window" LINK "WINSETS" 0}.

@{b}Software requirements@{ub}

iGame uses Magic User Interface (MUI) and some third party libraries. Depending your configuration the software requirements might change. In any case iGame will inform you about the missing required libraries if you run it from the shell.

All the required software is available on Aminet for free download.

@{u}Minimum requirements@{uu}

 - Kickstart 2.04 or higher
 - Workbench 2.1 or higher
 - MUI 3.8 or higher
 - guigfx.library
 - render.library
 - guigfx.mcc
 - Texteditor.mcc

If your Amiga has a 68000 CPU make sure that the libraries you have installed support it, i.e. there is a different MCC_TextEditor package for this processor. The same applies on CPUs that do not have FPU.

The @{b}AmigaOS 4 version@{ub} should work fine on any AmigaOS 4.0 update 6 release and above. It might work on previous versions, but it is not tested.

The @{b}MorphOS version@{ub} should work fine on any MorphOS 3.x release.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "INST" "Installation"
@{lindent 3}
@{b}Installer@{ub}
In iGame archive you will find an installation script, which you can use to install iGame on your hard disk. The installer recognizes the OS version and the available CPU, and proposes the best binary for you, but at the end you can choose the version you want to use.

Have in mind that the installer will not install any of the needed third party libraries. These must be installed manually by you.

@{b}Manual Installation@{ub}

You can install iGame manually if you prefer. To do that, you need to follow the following steps:

@{lindent 6}
1. Unpack the archive wherever you want.
2. Copy iGame drawer anywhere on your hard disk.
3. There are different executables of iGame based on CPU and Operating System. You need to find the one that is most suitable for your system and rename it as iGame.
@{tab}These are:
@{tab}iGame for 68000/68010/68020 CPUs
@{tab}iGame.030 for 68030 CPU
@{tab}iGame.040 for 68040 CPU
@{tab}iGame.060 for 68060 CPU
@{tab}iGame.OS4 for AmigaOS 4 and PPC CPU
@{tab}iGame.MOS for MorphOS and PPC CPU
4. Make sure igame.iff file is in the same directory as the binary.
5. Install required libs and MCCs suitable for your system.
6. Run iGame!

@{lindent 3}
iGame saves its support files on its own folder (PROGDIR:). We recommend you to install it on its own separated directory in your hard disk.

If you upgrade from a previous release, the only thing you need to do is to copy the new executable over the previous one. Make sure to keep the igame.prefs, gameslist.csv, genres and repos.prefs files!

@{b}NOTE:@{ub}

Make sure that render.library and guigfx.library are supported by your system and processor, if you choose to use them. If iGame fails with a Guru Meditation 8000000B or similar on startup, double check the libraries.

If it still persists, check http://winterland.no-ip.org/igame/files.html, where you will find an archive of these 2 libraries for systems with 020/no fpu (thanks to Jools 'buzz' Smyth for providing them!). These libraries might fix issues on 68030/882 systems as well.

If the problem is not gone, add the NOGUIGFX tooltype to iGame. This option will use MUI's internal datatypes loading routines (dtpic.mui) instead of guigfx.mcc's. In this case though, there will be no scaling of the used screenshots. This means that all the screenshots should have the same height and width, so to keep the GUI consistent.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "USAG" "Using iGame"
@{lindent 3}
If you are new to iGame and you would like a "fast first steps" guide then we recommend you to follow the next bullets:

- Select from the menu the "Settings > Game Repositories"
- Add to the list the folders were you keep your WHDLoad games
- Click the "Close" button
- Select from the menu the "Actions > Scan Repositories"
- As soon as the list appears double click on the game you want to play for this to start.

That's all. It is so simple, isn't it?

If you would like more details for all the available menus and windows, visit the following sections:

@ENDNODE
@NODE "MENUS" "Menus"
@{lindent 3}
@{b}Actions@{ub}
@{lindent 6}
@{u}Scan Repositories@{uu}
If you select "Scan Repositories", iGame will scan the paths you added at the @{" Game Repositories " LINK "WINREPO" 0} window and will try to find your available WHDLoad games and demos. This method supports ONLY WHDLoad games and demos. iGame checks the .slave files, and based on them creates a list of games and demos, which are later shown in the @{" Main Window " LINK "WINMAIN" 0}.

@{u}Add Game...@{uu}
This menu opens the @{" Add a Game " LINK "WINADDG" 0} window, which helps you add games/demos or any other executable you want into iGame list. You can also categorize them based on genre.

@{u}Show/Hide hidden entries@{uu}
This menu item hides all the entries from the list and shows only those that are marked as hidden. Filter field at the top and the genres list are disabled.

@{u}About...@{uu}
This menu item shows information about the application, the version and date of release and the target CPU. Also, you will find contact information of the developer and contributors.

@{u}Quit@{uu}
This menu item closes iGame.

@{lindent 3}
@{b}Game@{ub}
@{lindent 6}
@{u}Properties...@{uu}
This menu opens the @{" Properties " LINK "WINPROP" 0} window, where you can set more information for the selected entry, like the category, set it as favorite etc.. If no entry is selected an error message is shown.

@{u}Open Game Dir@{uu}
When you select "Open Game Dir", iGame will open a window on Workbench from the selected entry. This is useful when you need to check a manual or a guide that comes along with the game or demo.

@{lindent 3}
@{b}Settings@{ub}
@{lindent 6}
@{u}Settings...@{uu}
This menu opens the @{" Settings " LINK "WINSETS" 0} window, where you can configure how iGame will work for you, i.e. you can set the size of the screenshots etc..

@{u}Game Repositories...@{uu}
This menu opens the @{" Game Repositories " LINK "WINREPO" 0} window, where you can add/remove paths from your hard disk, where you keep your games and demos stored. These paths are useful for iGame only if they contain WHDLoad games/demos, and they are used to automatically recognize and build a list of them. If you do any changes in this list you have to rescan the Game Repositories using the menu item "Actions > Scan Repositories".

@{u}MUI Setting...@{uu}
This menu opens the MUI Settings window, where you can change the look of MUI components for iGame.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "WINMAIN" "Main Window"
@{lindent 3}
The Main Window is what you see when you start iGame. It is pretty simple to use and it has only a few fields.

At the top there is the "Filter" field which is used to filter the list of entries, based on your input. iGame returns entries with a matching part in their title. For example, if you want to find all the games that have "Soccer" in their title, that's what you need to write. The search is not case sensitive, so it doesn't matter if the part of the title is capitalized or not. From the iGame settings you can set when the search is initialized, while you type or after you press "Enter".

At the left side there is the list, where all the entries (games, demos etc.) are shown. With double click on an entry it is executed. If you want to add some information on an entry using the "Game > Properties..." menu, that's the list where you have to select it first.

At the top right side there is a screenshot of the selected entry. For the screenshot iGame uses an image file, which must be in the same folder with the game/demo, named @{b}igame.iff@{ub}. If no screenshot is available then the game icon is shown. You can disable the screenshots from the @{" Settings Window " LINK "WINSETS" 0} or the @{" Icon Tooltypes " LINK "ICNTLTP" 0}.

Under the screenshot there is the "Genres" list which help you filter the games based on the "Genre", as well as by "Last played", "Favorites", "Most Played" and "Never Played". There is also an "Unknown" selection which shows the entries that do not have any Genre assigned.

At the bottom there is a read only field which shows information about iGame, based on what you are doing. It is like a status bar, where useful information will be shown while you use iGame.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "WINADDG" "Add a Game Window..."
@{lindent 3}
This window opens from the menu "Actions > Add a Game". This is useful in cases you want to add a WDHLoad game/demo or any other game/demo which can be started from Workbench/Shell. Depending the AmigaOS version it uses compatible methods to run the executable.

By this window you can set the "Title" of the game/demo, select the path on HD of the executable and set its "Genre".

Click OK if you are fine with your selections, so that this new entry will be saved on the list. Click on "Cancel" if you changed your mind.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "WINREPO" "Game Repositories Window..."
@{lindent 3}
This window opens from the menu item "Settings > Game Repositories". There you can add your hard disk paths where you keep your WHDLoad games stored. These paths are going to be scanned when you select the menu item "Actions > Scan Repositories".

This window has a file field at the top. Click on the folder button to select the path from your hard disk, and then click button list to add it at the list below. If you want to remove a path, select it from the list and click the "Remove" button at the bottom of the window.

When you finish the changes on the repositories list, click "Close" button to close it. Remember that no changes on your game list will happen if you do not scan the repositories first, using the menu item "Actions > Scan Repositories".

@ENDNODE
@NODE "WINPROP" "Properties Window..."
@{lindent 3}
This window opens from the menu item "Game > Properties". For this to work you have to have an entry selected at the games list on the main window, otherwise an error message will show up. By this window you can change the properties of an entry.

From the top, the first field is the entry title, which you can change if you want.

Next you can set the Genre from the select list. This can be used from the Genres list at right side of the main window.

Following is a checkbox to set the entry as one of your favorites. To show your favorite games in the games list, select from the "Genre" list at the right side of the main window, the "--Favorites--" option.

Beside that is a checkbox to set the entry as hidden. This entry is going to be removed from the games list. To list all the hidden entries you have to select the menu item "Actions > Show/Hide hidden entries" from the main window.

The next field is the number of times this games was played. This is a read only field and you can't change the value.

The full path of the slave file, in case this is a WHDLoad entry, or the full path of the executable of any entry as set from the "Actions > Add a Game", is show at the next field. This is also a read only field and you cannot modify it.

After that there is a big text area, showing the icon tooltypes. This is extremely useful in case you want to change something on the entry, especially if it is a WHDLoad one, were the tooltypes can change the way it works.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "WINSETS" "Settings Window"
@{lindent 3}
The iGame settings window opens from the menu item "Settings > Settings...". This configuration selections override the iGame tooltypes set on its icon. These are saved on a text file named "igame.prefs", inside iGame folder. If this file is missing, iGame defaults to tooltypes.

Settings window has three separated sections:

@{u}Screenshots@{uu}
The first checkbox here, named "Hide Screenshots", disables the screenshot part of the main window. This change requires to restart iGame to be applied.

If screenshots are enabled you can select from the second checkbox if the GuiGfx library will be used. GuiGfx provides good scaling of the screenshot but it is a little bit tricky to set this up. You can find more info at @{" Installation " LINK "INST" 0} section. If this is checked iGame will not use the GuiGfx library.

After that there is a select box to choose the screenshot size. You can choose between 160x128 pixels, 320x256 pixels and custom, which let's you set the width and height manually, using the fields below the select box.

@{u}Titles@{uu}
The first two radio buttons set the way iGame gets the WHDLoad games/demos titles. These can be based on reading the slave files or by the game/demo parent folder name. If you choose the "Slave Contents" option the name can be more accurate, but the scanning is slower. "Directories" option is way faster, but if the slave inside a folder is not the one the directory is named, then there is a risk to have the wrong game in the list. Have in mind that if iGame finds multiple slaves for the same game, their titles will be suffixed with the 'Alt' word.

The "No Smart Spaces" disables the ability iGame to add extra spaces on game/demo title, where it believes it is needed, i.e. before a version number.

@{u}Misc@{uu}
"Save stats on exit" checkbox enables the save of the statistics (i.e. times played) for each game when iGame is closed instead every time a game is double clicked. This might be preferred if you don't want to have iGame writing many times on the hard disk.

"Use enter to filter" checkbox changes the filter field on the main window to be initiated when you press the enter key. By default, as soon as you type something in this field, the filtering of the games list happens in real time. On slow machines this might might be slow.

"Hide side panel" checkbox, if selected, hides the right side of the main window. This is useful if you don't need the screenshots and the filtering of the entries list by the options of the "Genres" list. This change requires to restart iGame to be applied.

"Display favorites on start" checkbox, if selected, iGame starts showing the games that are marked as "Favorite". This is useful when you have a big collection of games but you would like to start with your favorites ones, to select something for fast gaming.

"Save" button saves the settings in configuration file.
"Use" button applies the settings, except the ones that require to restart iGame, as mentioned above, but if you close iGame, those changes are lost.
"Cancel" button closes the window and forgets the changes you did.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "ICNTLTP" "Icon Tooltypes"
@{lindent 3}
Using iGame's icon tooltypes you can define how the program will work. The options are the same as can be found at the @{" Settings Window " LINK "WINSETS" 0}. Check this section to find more details for each option.

Place a tooltype in parenthesis to disable it.

@{b}NOSCREENSHOT@{ub} disables the screenshot
@{b}NOGUIGFX@{ub} makes iGame to not use the GuiGfx library
@{b}SCREENSHOT=WIDTHxHEIGHT@{ub} sets the screenshot width and height in pixels
@{b}FILTERUSEENTER@{ub} sets the filter field to be initiated with enter
@{b}SAVESTATSONEXIT@{ub} saves game statistics when iGame is closed
@{b}TITLESFROMDIRS@{ub} gets the game/demo title from its parent directory
@{b}NOSMARTSPACES@{ub} doesn't add extra spaces on title where it is needed
@{b}NOSIDEPANEL@{ub} hides the right side of the main window
